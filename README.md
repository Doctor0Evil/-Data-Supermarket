2. Verify KYC status for user456 to ensure compliance.
3. Convert $50 USD to FET cryptocurrency (assuming exchange rate 1 FET = $0.1, so 500 FET).
4. Check user456's wallet balance to confirm availability of at least 500 FET.
5. Broadcast the payment transaction using the nanoswarm network for fast, invisible, and secure processing.
6. Record the transaction on a distributed ledger, ensuring transparency and immutability.
